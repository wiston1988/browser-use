## Quick Example


```python
from browser_use import Tools, ActionResult, Browser

tools = Tools()

@tools.action('Ask human for help with a question')
def ask_human(question: str, browser: Browser) -> ActionResult:
    answer = input(f'{question} > ')
    return f'The human responded with: {answer}'

agent = Agent(
    task='Ask human for help',
    llm=llm,
    tools=tools,
)
```

<Note>
Use `browser` parameter in tools for deterministic [Actor](/customize/actor/basics) actions.
